Phase Stability Analysis:
----------------------------------------
Antenna 1 phase standard deviation: 104.70 degrees
Phase ratio standard deviation: 0.07 degrees

Observations:
1. Individual antenna phase varies due to:
   - Carrier frequency offset between Tx and Rx
   - Phase noise in local oscillators
   - Temperature variations in RF components
   - Environmental factors

2. Phase ratio stability:
   - Phase ratio is more stable than individual measurements
   - Common phase variations cancel out in the ratio
   - Remaining variations likely due to independent noise at each antenna
